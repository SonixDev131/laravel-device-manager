# Room Assignment Implementation - Complete Feature

## üéØ Feature Overview

This implementation provides a complete room assignment system where:

**üë®‚Äçüíº Admin Users Can:**

- Assign teachers to specific rooms
- Set assignment expiration dates
- Activate/deactivate assignments
- Remove assignments
- View all assignments in a management interface

**üë®‚Äçüè´ Teacher Users Can:**

- View only their assigned rooms
- Manage room computers (lock, unlock, restart, screenshots)
- Send messages to computers
- Block websites
- View command history
- Access room-specific controls only for assigned rooms

## üìä System Architecture

### Database Structure

```sql
user_room_assignments:
- id (UUID)
- user_id (UUID) -> users.id
- room_id (UUID) -> rooms.id
- is_active (BOOLEAN)
- assigned_at (TIMESTAMP)
- expires_at (TIMESTAMP, nullable)
- created_at, updated_at
```

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- **SuperAdmin Role**: Access to all rooms + admin features
- **Teacher Role**: Access only to assigned rooms + teaching features
- **Permission System**: 24 granular permissions covering all lab management aspects

## üîó URL Structure

### Admin Routes (SuperAdmin only)

- `GET /admin/room-assignments` - Management interface
- `POST /admin/assign-teacher` - Assign teacher to room
- `DELETE /admin/room-assignments/{assignment}` - Remove assignment
- `PATCH /admin/room-assignments/{assignment}` - Update assignment

### Teacher Routes

- `GET /teacher/my-rooms` - Teacher's assigned rooms dashboard

### Protected Room Routes (Room access middleware)

- `GET /rooms/{room}` - View specific room (requires access)
- `POST /rooms/{room}/commands` - Send commands (requires access)
- `GET /rooms/{room}/commands` - View history (requires access)
- `POST /rooms/{room}/update-agents` - Update agents (requires access)

## üé® User Interface

### Admin Interface (`/admin/room-assignments`)

**Features:**

- Teacher-to-room assignment form with expiration dates
- Real-time assignment status display
- Activate/deactivate toggle buttons
- Assignment removal functionality
- Comprehensive assignment history

**Components:**

- Dropdown teacher selection
- Dropdown room selection
- DateTime picker for expiration
- Status badges (Active/Inactive)
- Action buttons (Deactivate/Activate/Remove)

### Teacher Interface (`/teacher/my-rooms`)

**Features:**

- Grid layout of assigned rooms
- Real-time computer statistics (Online/Offline/Locked)
- Quick action buttons for common tasks
- Room-specific access controls
- Permission-based UI elements

**Room Statistics:**

- Online/Offline/Locked computer counts
- Visual status indicators
- Room layout information (grid dimensions)

**Quick Actions (Permission-based):**

- Lock/Unlock all computers
- Take screenshots
- Restart all computers
- Send broadcast messages

**Advanced Actions:**

- View room layout
- Command history
- Website blocking management

## üîí Security Implementation

### Middleware Protection

```php
// EnsureUserHasRoomAccess middleware
Route::middleware(['room.access'])->group(function () {
    Route::post('/rooms/{room}/commands', [RoomCommandController::class, 'publish']);
    Route::get('/rooms/{room}/commands', [RoomCommandHistoryController::class, 'index']);
    // ... other room-specific routes
});
```

### Permission Checks

```php
// Combined role + room access validation
if (!$user->can('send-lock-command')) {
    return response()->json(['message' => 'Unauthorized'], 403);
}

// SuperAdmin bypass logic
if ($user->hasRole('super-admin')) {
    return $next($request); // Access all rooms
}

// Teacher room-specific access
if (!$user->hasAccessToRoom($roomId)) {
    return response()->json(['message' => 'Access denied'], 403);
}
```

### UUID Security

- All primary keys use UUIDs to prevent enumeration attacks
- Foreign key relationships properly maintain UUID consistency
- Route model binding works seamlessly with UUID identifiers

## üì± Navigation Integration

### Dynamic Sidebar Menu

The navigation adapts based on user roles:

**Teacher Navigation:**

- Dashboard
- My Rooms (teacher-specific)
- Rooms (filtered to assigned only)

**Admin Navigation:**

- Dashboard
- My Rooms (if also a teacher)
- Rooms (all rooms)
- Room Assignments (admin management)
- Agents Management

## üéÆ Usage Examples

### Test Users

```bash
# Admin Account
Email: admin@example.com
Password: password
Role: super-admin

# Teacher Account
Email: teacher@example.com
Password: password
Role: teacher
```

### Admin Workflow

1. Login as `admin@example.com`
2. Navigate to **Room Assignments**
3. Select teacher and room from dropdowns
4. Set optional expiration date
5. Click **Assign Teacher**
6. Manage existing assignments (activate/deactivate/remove)

### Teacher Workflow

1. Login as `teacher@example.com`
2. Navigate to **My Rooms**
3. View assigned rooms with statistics
4. Use quick actions (Lock All, Screenshots, etc.)
5. Click **View Room** for detailed management
6. Access command history and website blocking

## üîß Technical Features

### Model Relationships

```php
// User Model
public function activeAssignedRooms(): BelongsToMany
public function hasAccessToRoom(string $roomId): bool

// UserRoomAssignment Model
public function user(): BelongsTo
public function room(): BelongsTo
public function isActive(): bool
```

### Action Classes

```php
// AssignTeacherToRoomAction
public function handle(User $teacher, Room $room, ?Carbon $expiresAt = null): UserRoomAssignment
public function revoke(User $teacher, Room $room): bool
public function deactivate(User $teacher, Room $room): bool
```

### Vue.js Components

- **RoomAssignments.vue** - Admin management interface
- **MyRooms.vue** - Teacher dashboard
- **AppSidebar.vue** - Role-based navigation
- Heroicons integration for modern UI
- Tailwind CSS for responsive design

## ‚úÖ Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Features

1. **Database Schema**: UUID-based room assignments table
2. **RBAC System**: Role and permission integration
3. **Middleware Protection**: Room access validation
4. **Admin Interface**: Complete assignment management
5. **Teacher Interface**: Room dashboard with controls
6. **Navigation**: Dynamic role-based menus

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running Demo

The application is now running at: `http://localhost` (or your Docker host)

**Test the complete workflow:**

1. Login with admin account ‚Üí Assign rooms
2. Login with teacher account ‚Üí Manage assigned rooms
3. Verify access control ‚Üí Teachers can't access unassigned rooms

## üìà Performance & Scalability
