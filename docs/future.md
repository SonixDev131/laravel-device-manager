GitHub Copilot: # Workflow After Agent Auto-Registration

After an agent has successfully auto-registered with your management system, several next steps would typically occur:

## 1. Computer Appears in Room Layout

- The newly registered computer will automatically appear in your room grid layout
- The computer metadata (hostname, IP, OS info) collected during registration will be displayed
- No manual configuration is needed since the agent sent all required information during registration

## 2. Agent Establishes WebSocket Connection

The next step would involve:

```php
// Backend would handle WebSocket connections from agents
class AgentConnectionHandler
{
    public function handleConnection($connection, $request)
    {
        // Authenticate connection using the installation token
        // Store connection reference for sending commands
        // Update computer status to "online"
    }
}
```

## 3. Implement Agent Command Handling

Since you already have the command infrastructure (as seen in ComputerControls.vue), you need to:

- Create command handlers in your agent code to execute different operations:
  - Power commands (shutdown, restart)
  - Session commands (lock, logout)
  - Screenshot capture
  - Message display
  
- Implement status reporting from agent to server:
  - Heartbeat/keepalive messages
  - Command execution results
  - System metrics (CPU, memory, etc.)

## 4. Enhance the Room Layout UI

Add indicators showing:

- Connection status (online/offline)
- Agent version
- Last heartbeat time 
- System information panel

## 5. Testing and Validation

Create a testing workflow to verify:

- Agent installation works across different OS versions
- Commands are properly executed
- Registration process is reliable
- Connection remains stable over time

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect of this workflow? For example, I could detail the WebSocket connection management or the agent command execution architecture.
