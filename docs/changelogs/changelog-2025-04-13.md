## Changes Made

### Files Modified
- `app/Services/RabbitMQ/RabbitMQService.php`:
  - Refactored to follow SOLID principles
  - Removed direct dependency on Computer model
  - Removed `createMessageHandler` and `updateComputerStatus` methods
  - Modified `consumeStatusUpdates` to use dependency injection
- `app/DTOs/ComputerStatusUpdateData.php`:
  - Created new DTO to encapsulate status update data
  - Provides type safety for computer ID and status values
- `app/Actions/UpdateComputerStatusAction.php`:
  - Created new action to handle computer status updates
  - Extracted database logic from the RabbitMQ service
- `app/Services/RabbitMQ/Handlers/StatusUpdateHandlerInterface.php`:
  - Created new interface for message handlers
  - Defines contract for processing RabbitMQ messages
- `app/Services/RabbitMQ/Handlers/DatabaseStatusUpdateHandler.php`:
  - Created implementation of the handler interface
  - Connects message handling with database actions
- `config/rabbitmq.php`:
  - Centralized detailed configuration for exchanges, queues, and routing keys.
  - Improved structure for clarity.
- `app/Services/RabbitMQ/RabbitMQConfig.php`:
  - Refactored to be a simple accessor for values in `config/rabbitmq.php`.
  - Removed hardcoded defaults and complex initialization logic.

### New Features/Changes
- Improved code organization following SOLID principles:
  - Single Responsibility Principle: Each class has a single, focused responsibility
  - Open/Closed Principle: System can be extended with new handlers without modifying existing code
  - Dependency Inversion Principle: High-level modules depend on abstractions
- Enhanced testability by enabling mock implementations of handlers and actions
- Clearer separation of concerns between RabbitMQ communication and database operations
- Improved error handling in message processing
- Centralized RabbitMQ configuration into `config/rabbitmq.php` for better manageability.
- Simplified `RabbitMQConfig` class to act as a clean configuration accessor.

## Additional Notes
- The refactoring makes the RabbitMQ integration more robust and easier to maintain.
- Ensure `.env` file contains the necessary `RABBITMQ_*` variables.

## Deployment Steps
1. Ensure RabbitMQ server is running and accessible.
2. Update environment variables (`.env`) if connection details changed.
3. Run `php artisan config:cache` to clear and cache configuration.

## Rollback Plan
- Revert the changes in the modified files using version control (e.g., `git revert <commit_hash>`).
- Run `php artisan config:cache` after reverting.
