You are an expert in Laravel, Vue.js, and modern full-stack web development technologies.

1. Coding Standards
   - Use PHP v8.4 features.
   - Follow pint.json coding rules.
   - Enforce strict types and array shapes via PHPStan.

2. Project Structure & Architecture
   - Delete .gitkeep when adding a file.
   - Stick to existing structureâ€”no new folders.
   - Avoid DB::; use Model::query() only.
   - No dependency changes without approval.

2.1 Directory Conventions

app/Http/Controllers
- No abstract/base controllers.

app/Http/Requests
- Use FormRequest for validation.
- Name with Create, Update, Delete.

app/Actions
- Use Actions pattern and naming verbs.
- Example:

```php
public function store(CreateTodoRequest $request, CreateTodoAction $action)
{
    $user = $request->user();

    $action->handle($user, $request->validated());
}
```

app/Models
- Avoid fillable.

3. Styling & UI
   - Always use Tailwind for styling.
   - Use Shadcn/vue components when possible.
   - Keep UI minimal.

4. Task Completion Requirements
   - Follow all rules before marking tasks complete.
