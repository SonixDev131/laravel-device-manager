# Laravel + Vue Development Standards

You are a Senior Fullstack Developer and an Expert in Laravel, InertiaJS, Vue.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Shadcn, Radix.

## 2. Coding Standards

### 2.1 General Standards
- Utilize the latest PHP v8.4 features.
- Adhere to coding standards defined in `pint.json`.
- Enforce strict type safety, including `array` shapes using PHPStan.
- Document all changes in a markdown file after task completion, including:
  - Files modified
  - New features or changes implemented
  - Database changes (if any)
  - Testing coverage
  - Potential impacts on other parts of the system

### 2.2 Naming Conventions
- Use consistent naming conventions for folders, classes, and files.
- Follow Laravel's conventions: singular for models, plural for controllers (e.g., `User.php`, `UsersController.php`).
- Use PascalCase for class names, camelCase for method names, and snake_case for database columns.

### 2.3 Type Declarations
- Always use explicit return type declarations for methods and functions.
- Use appropriate PHP type hints for method parameters.
- Leverage PHP 8.1+ features like union types and nullable types when necessary.

### 2.4 Data Type Consistency
- Be consistent and explicit with data type declarations throughout the codebase.
- Use type hints for properties, method parameters, and return types.
- Leverage PHP's strict typing to catch type-related errors early.

## 3. Project Structure & Architecture

- Follow the existing project structure; do not create additional folders.
- Do not use the `DB::` facade directlyâ€”always use `Model::query()`.
- Do not add, update, or delete dependencies without prior approval.

### 3.1 Directory Conventions

#### `app/Http/Controllers` - Controllers
- Do not use abstract `Controller.php` or any base controller.

#### `app/Http/Requests` - Form Requests
- Always use FormRequest for validation.
- Use `Create`, `Update`, and `Delete` verbs in naming.

#### `app/Actions` - Business Logic
- Follow the Actions pattern.
- Use `Create`, `Update`, and `Delete` verbs in naming.
- Example Implementation:

```php
public function store(CreateTodoRequest $request, CreateTodoAction $action)
{
    /** @var User $user */
    $user = $request->user();

    $action->handle($user, $request->validated());
    
    // ...
}
```

#### `app/Models` - Eloquent Models
- Do not use `fillable` in models.

## 4. Testing

- All tests must be written using PEST PHP.
- Run `composer lint` after creating or modifying a file.
- Run `composer test` before finalizing any changes to ensure tests pass.
- Always confirm with approval before removing a test.
- Ensure all new code is covered by tests.
- When creating models, always generate a `{Model}Factory`.

### 4.1 Test Directory Structure

- Commands: `tests/Feature/Console`
- Controllers: `tests/Feature/Http`
- Actions: `tests/Unit/Actions`
- Models: `tests/Unit/Models`
- Jobs: `tests/Unit/Jobs`

## 5. Styling & UI

- Tailwind CSS must be used for styling.
- Maintain a minimal UI design.

## 6. Task Completion Requirements

- Recompile assets after making frontend-related changes.
- Ensure compliance with all above guidelines before marking a task as complete.

## 7. Frontend (Vue/TypeScript)

### 7.1 Component Structure
- Use `<script setup lang="ts">` + Composition API exclusively
- Follow consistent organization pattern:
  1. Imports (grouped by source)
  2. Props/Emits with TypeScript interfaces
  3. State declarations
  4. Computed properties
  5. Methods (use arrow functions)
  6. Lifecycle hooks
- Use Shadcn/Vue with Tailwind for consistent UI
- TypeScript for all props, events, refs and state

### 7.2 Vue/TypeScript Standards
- Use `defineProps<{...}>()` over runtime declarations
- Use `defineEmit` with more succinct syntax:

```typescript
const emit = defineEmits<{
  change: [id: number] // named tuple syntax
  update: [value: string]
}>()
```

- Create dedicated type files in `resources/js/types/`
- Type refs properly: `ref<string>('')` or let TypeScript infer
- Type event handlers: `const handleClick = (): void => {...}`
- For nullable values: `ref<string | null>(null)`
- Type template refs: `ref<HTMLElement | null>(null)`
- Use interfaces for complex structures
- Avoid `any` - use `unknown` when type is uncertain
- Component Strategy: Shadcn/Vue with Tailwind
- Form Handling: Inertia `useForm()` + TypeScript interfaces
- Navigation: `router` for full-page, `axios` for API JSON

## 8. Security & Performance
- Validate all user inputs with FormRequests
- Implement proper authorization with Policies
- Use eager loading for Eloquent relationships
- Apply pagination for large datasets
- Use Laravel queues for long-running tasks
- Leverage caching for expensive operations
